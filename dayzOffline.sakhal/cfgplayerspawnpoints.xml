                Spawn groups (<group>) are groups that will be selected for a certain period of time (lifetime) or spawns (counter).
                Groups are chosen randomly, ignoring the current and the group which was selected most recently before it.
                
                When only lifetime is filled in, the group will be alive for the amount of seconds specified.
                If a player logs in after the lifetime has run out, the group will automatically be swapped.
                
                When only counter is filled in, the group will only be active for that many logins.
                The system will choose a new group once this counter has reached 0.
                
                When both are active, the lifetime will be ticking down, but when a player logs in, the lifetime will be refreshed.
                As long as the counter is not 0, the lifetime will continue to be refreshed when a player logs in before the lifetime runs out.
                
                Be aware that this is only checked on player log in, so it will not swap for as long as nobody is logging in.
